Task Details

This dataset designed to understand the factors that lead a person will work for the company(leaving current job) ,and the goal of this task is building model(s) that uses the current credentials,demographics,experience to predict the probability of a candidate looking for a new job or will work for the company.

The whole data divided to train and test . Also sample submission has been provided correspond to enrollee_ id of test set ( enrolle_ id | target)

    Note:
        The dataset is imbalanced so it might affect your result if you dont handle it
        Most features are categorical (Nominal, Ordinal, Binary), some with high cardinality so encoding methods and techniques will help to boost models performance
        Missing imputation strategy might affect the results so it can be a part of your pipeline as well.

Expected Submission

Solution Notebook with following mandatory outputs:

        Prediction: for each row in test data the predicted probability of candidate looking for a job, (probability of the class with the greater label).Format is given in sample_submission.csv:
            enrollee_id : Unique ID for enrollee
            target : probability of an enrollee looking for a job change

        Model Evaluation: roc_ auc_ score of (answer,prediction probability of rows in test data)
        *answer: test target values(download from : https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/job-change-dataset-answer)

        Model Interpretation: Interpret model(s) such a way that illustrate which features affect candidates decision

Evaluation

The evaluation metric is area under the ROC curve score.

You have better first evaluate your model(s) with your selected strategy (KFold CV, hold_ out,â€¦) and then predict test (sample_submission) and finally compare the result for your own with test target values and find out your model performance on unseen data and your model fitness.

The pipeline you apply for getting result (EDA, preprocessing, feature engineering and selection , model building and evaluation strategy and so on, will be evaluated by your model performance on unseen data(aug_test.csv)
